# One Click Backup
### A single-point backup tool for my mom's work computer.
Version **1.2.2**

---
This tool will first look for the drive labeled *Backup* and attempt to 
update all files from the execution point's drive (typically C:). Next 
the tool will look for the drive labeled *Duplicate* and bring updates 
over from *Backup* in an attempt to make the two external drives 
identical.

**Note** that for the integrety of this backup system to be maintained, 
no updates are brought from the execution point's drive to the duplicate 
drive - only from *Backup* to *Duplicate*.
